# Spring Security

**Spring Security** is a framework that provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks.
Also, provides integration with other libraries to simplify its usage.

To work with _Spring Security_, it is good to have a clear idea about two concepts: 

* **Authentication:** It's about proving that I really am who I say I am. To do this, I need to use passwords or other ways to prove my identity.
_Spring Security_ provides built in support for authenticating users, be it a servlet or webflux application.

* **Authorization:** It's about determined what I can do in application. 
Similarity Authentication, _Spring Security_ have methods and features that helps determine and validate what a user can do.

## Spring Security and Spring Boot

When we use Spring Boot, it's automatically realize a default configuration, that basically does two things: 
* Creates a servlet _Filter_ as a bean named `springSecurityFilterChain`, responsible for all the security within your application, and register its in _Servlet Container_
* Create a bean of type `UserDetailsService`, with username **_user_** and a randomly generated password, printed in the console.

> **_Obs.:_** Spring Boot make things easily, but we don't need to use it. Like other Springs projects, it's possible use Spring Security without use Spring Boot.

## Spring Security with Servlet Applications

In this repository we focus in use _Spring Security_ with **Servlet Applications**. With this type of application, _Spring Security_ it'll work based on **Servlet Filter**.
 
When client sends a request to the application, the container creates a `FilterChain` and the `Servlet` that should process the `HttpServletRequest`, both things based on the path of the request URI.
In a Spring MVC application the _Servlet_ is an instance of `DispacherServlet`. 
At most one _Servlet_ can handle a single request and response, but more than one _Filter_ can be used to change, validate or even reject the request. 
This sequence of filters known `FilterChain`, and the order of filters in this chain are extremely important.

### Servlets Filters

First of all, Spring provides a _Filter_ implementation named `DelegatingFilterProxy` that allows bridging between the _Servlet_ container's lifecycle and Spring's _Application Context_, since _Servlet_ container not aware Spring's Beans. 
`DelegatingFiterProxy` can be registered via standard _Servlet_ container mechanisms and after delegates all the work to a Spring Bean that implements Filter interface.

Usually the bean wrapped in a `DelegatingFilterProxy` is the `FilterChainProxy`, that is a special _Filter_ that allows delegating the request to many _Filter_ instances through `SecurityFilterChain`.
So, `SecurityFilterChain` is used by `FilterChainProxy` to determine which _Spring Security Filter_ should be invoked for the request.

![alt text](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.4.1/reference/html5/images/servlet/architecture/securityfilterchain.png "Sequence show DelegatingFilterProxy, his FilterChainProxy and the SecurityFilterChain")

With this architecture, _Spring Security_ has a starting point for all support, centralize some tasks and provide flexibility, determining invocation based on anything in the request.

It allows more than one `SecurityFilterChain` bean. In this case, `FilterChainProxy` can be used to determine which `SecurityFilterChain` should be used, find the first chain that matches to the request. 
This allows providing a separate configuration for different slices of the application, when each chain can have the numbers of filters whatever is needed.

#### Security Filters

_Spring Security_ has a lot of filters, that can be use for many situations. Some examples are **CsrfFilter**, **OAuth2AuthorizationRequestRedirectFilter** and **BasicAuthenticationFilter**. 
Of course, we don't need to use them all. They can be configured according applications' necessity, and as we said, we can have different groups of filters.

Again, the order of filters matters, and the filters provided by _Spring Security_ has they own order. 
It isn't necessary know this ordering, however there are times that it is beneficial to know this.

## Authentication

_Spring Security_ provides comprehensive support for **Authentication**. Let's see the main architectural components of _Spring Security's_ used in _Servlet_ authentication.

### Security Context Holder

`SecurityContextHolder` is in the heart of _Spring Security's_ authentication model. It's here that the details of who is authenticated is store. 
It doesn't matter how is populated, if it contains a value, then it is used as the currently authenticated user.

The `SecurityContextHolder` contains the `SecurityContext`, which in turn contains an `Authentication` object.

By default, the `SecurityContextHolder` uses a **_ThreadLocal_** to store these details, which means that the `SecurityContext` is always available to methods in the same thread, even if is not explicitly passed around as an argument.
Using a ThreadLocal in this way is quite safe if care is taken to clear the thread after the present principalâ€™s request is processed.
_Spring Security's_ `FilterChainProxy` ensures that the `SecurityContext` is always cleared.

### Authentication

The `Authentication` server two main purposes within _Spring Security_: provide the credentials a user provided to authenticate, and represents the currently authenticated user, obtained from the `SecurityContext`.

This object contains: 

* **`principal`:** identifies the user, in most time an instance of `UserDetails`.
* **`credentials`:** often a password, that will be cleared after the user is authenticated.
* **`authorities`:** permissions the user is granted, like roles or scopes.

### Granted Authority

`GrantedAuthority` is an authority that is granted to the principal. A few examples are roles or scopes. 
These roles/scopes are later on configured for web authorization, method authorization and domain object authorization.
Other parts of _Spring Security_ are capable of interpreting these authorities, and expect them to be present. 
When using username/password based authentication, `GrantedAuthority` are usually loaded by the `UserDetailsService`.

### Authentication Manager and Authentication Provider

`AuthenticationManager` is the API that defines how _Spring Security's_ Filters perform authentication. 
It's not mandatory use an `AuthenticationManager`, but when we use, it's responsible to return the `Authentication` object that will be stored in `SecurityContextHolder` by the controller. 

The implementation of `AuthenticationManager` could be anything, but the most common is `ProviderManager`. 
This implementation delegates the authentication to a list of `AuthenticationProvider`, where each one knows how to perform a specific type of authentication. 
For example, `DaoAuthenticationProvider` supports username/password based authentication, while `JwtAuthenticationProvider` supports authentication a JWT token.  
This allows different types of authentication and exposing a single `AuthenticationManager` bean.

During the authentication process, each `AuthenticationProvider` has an opportunity to indicate that authentication should be successful, fail, or indicate it cannot make a decision and allow a downstream provider to decide.
If none of the providers in list can authenticate, then authentication will fail with a `ProviderNotFoundException`, that indicates the `ProviderManager` was not configured to support the type of `Authentication` that was passed into it.
 
### AuthenticationEntryPoint and AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter

`AuthenticationEntryPoint` is used to send an HTTP response that request credentials from a client, when the client try to make an unauthenticated request to a resource that they are not authorized to access.
In this case an implementation of `AuthenticationEntryPoint` is used to request credentials from the client.  

With this, an `AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter` is used as a base _Filter_ for authenticating a user's credentials. 
When the user submits their credentials, it creates an `Authentication` from the request. This object depends on the subclass of `AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter`.
For example, `UserPasswordAuthenticationFilter` creates a `UserPasswordAuthenticationToken` from a username and password send with the request.

Next, the `Authentication` is passed into the `AuthenticationManager` to be authenticated. 
If fails, the `SecurityContextHolder` is cleared out and `AuthenticationFailureHandler` is invoked.
If success, the `Authentication` object is set on the `SecurityContextHolder` and `AuthenticationSuccessHandler`.
